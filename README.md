# Pokemon API

Pokemon API is a simple microservice exposing the endpoint:

**GET** _/pokemon/{name}_

returning the Pokemon description as a JSON response in the format:

```JSON
{
  "name" : "charizard",
  "description" : "Charizard flies 'round the sky in search of powerful opponents."
}
```

It is build on top of [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/), a Java based microservices framework.

## Prerequisites

You will need to install Java version 11 at least.
Follow the instructions at https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `pokemon-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `/target` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/pokemon-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/pokemon-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.html.
